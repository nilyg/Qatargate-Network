  <p>Editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post, published articles that were interpreted as taking a positive stance regarding Qatar after a trip in Qatar.</p>
  <p>According to Klein‚Äôs testimony, <a href="shrulik.html">Yisrael Einhorn</a> arranged his trip to Qatar, coordinated by Qatari lobbyist <a href="footlik.html">Jay Footlik</a>, who accompanied Klein to high-level meetings. During the visit, Klein stayed in contact with Einhorn.
  </p>
  <p>
    After publishing an article in March 2024, Klein said Einhorn encouraged him to give media interviews, arranged for <a href="feldstein.html">Eli Feldstein</a> to help promote them and said that the "American" will take care of the payment, referring to Footlik. Klein testified that Feldstein coordinated with Footlik and secured interviews on major Israeli TV channels.

    Messages found on the phones of Klein and Feldstein confirmed their coordination with Footlik and Einhorn.
